# What is URAGE ?
URAGE is a *key-value based, b-tree implemented local* database. It is specifically designed for mobile applications, desktop applications, offline video games. With its *speed,  lightness and easy syntax*, URAGE stands  among other databases.

## Workflow

URAGE works with .dat and .idx files to save data. It supports *ACID properties*, ensuring save and reliable data saving. After building URAGE, users can choose to add data via either URAGE CLI or C++ code.

#  🪟 Windows installation

 

  

    # 1. Download URAGE 
    # Go to https://github.com/abdullahtnz/urage and download the ZIP file

> As mentioned above, you can use urage via CLI or C++ code.

# How to use URAGE in CLI

   ## Windows & Linux
   

    # Go to urage\build folder
    cd C:\my_project\build
    ./urage_cli filename  # This creates or opens a file in the build folder only.
    
    To open or create file in other direction:
    cd C:\my_project\my_folder # Go to the folder where you want your file.
    urage_cli filename

# How to use URAGE in C++ 
Installation process already covers almost everything. All you need to do is simply adding **#include <urage.hpp>** and then use it with proper syntax.

    main.cpp
	   
	   #include <urage.hpp>
	   
	   int main() {
     // Open database (creates "save.idx" and "save.dat")
     urage::Database db("save");
      
     // Save player
     db.add(1, "Hero");
     db.add(2, "100 HP");
      
     // Load player
     std::cout << db.get(1) << std::endl;  // Shows: Hero
      
     return 0;
    }

# URAGE CLI Documentation

 ### General commands
 

 - help -> to see all possible commands and usage
 - exit -> to save and quit
 
 ### Numeric key commands
 

> URAGE handles numeric keys and string keys differently; hence, these commands exists.

    
   addn key value -> **add** numeric key with value (value can be both string and num)
   getn key -> **get** numeric key and its value
   deln key -> **delete** numeric key and its value
   existsn -> **check** if a numeric key exist or not

### String key commands
adds key value -> **add** string key with value (value can be both string and num)
gets key -> **gets** string key and its value
dels key -> **delete** string key and its value
exist_str -> **check** if a string key exist or not

### Type commands

> Types are user-defined, flexible structures.

define name { field1 field1's data type field2 field2's data type } -> **define** a new type
undefine name -> **delete** a type
desc name -> **see** a type and its fields

### Adding/Getting a type data
add typename key field1=value field2=value -> **add** item as type
get typename key -> **get** a type's specific item

<hr>

## To understand types better, here is how you can use it.

 

       # 1. Open your database
    urage_cli mygame
    
    # 2. Define a player type
    urage> define player {
        name string(32) # 32 here is the size of string
        hp int
        level int
        gold int
        class string(16) # 16 is size here too
    }
    # so, as you can see we need to specify size of string in type, pls be careful or simply write 255 if you don't mind memory usage
    
    # 3. Add a player (key = 1)
    urage> add player 1 name="Hero" hp=100 level=5 gold=250 class="warrior"
    
    # 4. Add another player (key = 2)
    urage> add player 2 name="Mage" hp=80 level=7 gold=450 class="wizard"
    
    # 5. Get player data
    urage> get player 1
    # Output: name="Hero" hp=100 level=5 gold=250 class="warrior"
    
    urage> get player 2
    # Output: name="Mage" hp=80 level=7 gold=450 class="wizard"
    
    # 6. Check if player exists
    urage> get player 3
    # Output: player:3 not found
    
    # 7. View type definition
    urage> desc player
    # Output shows all fields with their types
    
    # 8. Update player (overwrites)
    urage> add player 1 name="Hero" hp=85 level=6 gold=300 class="warrior"
    
    # 9. Verify update
    urage> get player 1
    # Output: name="Hero" hp=85 level=6 gold=300 class="warrior"
    
    # 10. Check database stats
    urage> stats
    # Output shows total keys, data size, etc.
    
    # 11. Exit
    urage> exit

### Transaction commands
Transactions works like a surgeon, begin, does its job, and commit and done. It is used for updating values in database. The best use case of transactions is game development. 
begin -> **start** the transaction process
commit -> **end** the transaction process
rollback -> **rollback** the transaction ( if the transaction fails, use this)


Here is an example:

    urage> define player {id int hp int level int}
    urage> add player 1 id=123 hp=100 level=0
    # Say at this point, player won a fight against monster
    urage> begin #start transaction
    urage> add player 1 id=123 hp=45 level=1
    urage> commit #commit and save changes

# Using URAGE in C++
This is the most important part, because databases don't just stay there as it is. People connect them with their code to write APIs. For now, URAGE only supports C++, further updates will cover far more languages such as Vyne, Python, Java, Go. It also supports C because it is written in it.

    
    // Open database
    urage::Database db("filename"); 
    
    // Numeric keys
    db.add(1, "value");
    std::string v = db.get(1);
    db.remove(1);
    if (db.exists(1)) {}
    
    // String keys
    db.put_str("key", "value");
    std::string v = db.get_str("key");
    db.remove_str("key");
    if (db.exists_str("key")) {}
    
    // Typed data
    db.define_type("name", {{"field", TYPE_INT}});
    db.add_typed("name", 1, "field=100");
    std::string v = db.get_typed("name", 1);
    auto fields = db.describe_type("name");
    db.undefine_type("name");
    
    // Transactions
    db.begin();
    db.commit();
    db.rollback();
    if (db.in_transaction()) {}
    
    // Utilities
    db.sync();
    auto stats = db.stats();
    std::string err = db.get_last_error();

**As estimated values shows, URAGE is faster and better than some of other local databases. Of course, it can't compete with them, becuase other databases have plenty of features that can be used for any purposes. What makes URAGE better than them is its strict syntax and focus on core functions. In other words, URAGE is designed for specific use cases, and this is what makes it better at those.**
